QJackAudio sample app.

Features:

* Uses QJackAudio, works with JACK
* 24 channels routed to 8 subgroups each with direct out
* Three-band parametric EQ for each channel
* Aux send/return for each channel, so you can hook in other effects processors
* Save and restore complete EQ states
* Clean source code and free sofware licensed under GPL
* Using latest Qt5, which means it runs on all major platforms

Please understand that I am using Ubuntu GNU/Linux myself, so I can hardly give you support concerning compiling and packaging on other platforms. If you are interested in doing that, I will gladly add your instructions here in the README. Also, if you want to be able to build with another build system, I can add your build configuration files so users can choose what they like most.
